Hi everyone, my name is Joseph and I'm the creator of Robot Assembly.

Robot Assembly is a game about designing and programming automated production lines.
With this game I want to explore the fun of problem solving and programming.
There are other programming games but I'm designing Robot Assembly to be accessible for all age and skill levels. Plus there are robots that are physically simulated!

For progress updates you can follow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/robot_assembly

Cheers!
